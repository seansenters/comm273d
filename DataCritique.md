#Data Critique

For this assignment, I am critiquing an article done by Kevin Cirill from [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/218812-poll-finds-mounting-frustration-with-economy), analyzing people's reaction to the slow economic recovery.

### What is the data used for this assignment, and where did it come from?

Kevin Cirill used a poll conducted by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development, established at Rutgers University.
The poll was part of a study called [Left Behind: The Long-Term Unemployed Struggle in an Improving Economy](http://heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/products/uploads/Work_Trends_September_2014_0.pdf).

### What is the "birth story" of the data?

The birth of this data was from a poll conducted between July 24 and August 3 of this past year regarding economic conditions in America.
Many citizens have been critical of the Obama administration for the tedious economic recovery that has plagued his Presidency, which would provide the motivation for this data to be collected, especially by an independent source.

### What claims does the story make based off of the data?

The article claims that the economic picture in the United States looks bleak, with 20% of the sample being laid off of their jobs since June 2009.
However, it uses the collection of testimonial data as opposed to simply economic statistics, adding a more human component to the story.
Additionally, it uses data from a previous study to claim that the economy is doing worse than it was last year by taking testimonies of people regarding their long-term outlook on the economy.

### What are the limitations of the data?

I believe one of the largest limitations of the survey taken is the fact that there are only a little over 1,000 US residents polled in the survey.  It seems like a very small amount of people to be surveyed in such a large workforce.  Another flaw I see with the article is that it cites polls from previous years, and yet those are not linked.  I don't know if this is a large deal, but it does make me slightly question the validity of these polls, and it makes it seem like they are pulling numbers out of thin air.

### Can you find where this original data exists online?  If so, post the relevant URLs.

I linked the article as well as the study above.
